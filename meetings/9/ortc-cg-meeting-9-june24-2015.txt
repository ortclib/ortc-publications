[10:16] <robinraymond> RTCIceCandidateComplete - is the dictionary needed?
[10:16] <robinraymond> dictionary vs method?
[10:20] <robinraymond> consensus to add "notify do not expect any more remote candidates" to RTCIceTransport
[10:20] <robinraymond> Peter proposed method, Shijin agreed.
[10:20] <robinraymond> Robin - no strong leanings, but likes method too
[10:21] <robinraymond> need a name that makes sense
[10:22] <robinraymond> WebRTC 1.0 no longer allows nullable addRemoteCandidate
[10:25] <robinraymond> RTCIceTransport state changes - has two additional arrows from WebRTC 1.0
[10:25] <robinraymond> WebRTC 1.0 missing state from connected to checking
[10:26] <robinraymond> possible state change from failed to checking depending what happens with continous nominiation
[10:26] <robinraymond> getStates: on closed objects - what do we do/
[10:26] <robinraymond> getStates currently throws an error
[10:27] <robinraymond> if object is closed
[10:27] <robinraymond> why are we throwing exceptions when object is closed?
[10:29] <robinraymond> getStates should not return an error, at most a rejected promise if can't be fulfilled
[10:32] <robinraymond> WebRTC 1.0 should change DTMF to Dtmf
[10:37] <robinraymond> we don't need "generation" for ICE candidates, Peter T mentioned gice is going to move away from it
[10:39] <robinraymond> privacy for related address on ICE
[10:40] <robinraymond> related address could be empty on ICE
[10:40] <robinraymond> related address could be empty on ICE candidate
[10:40] <robinraymond> issue #213
[10:41] <robinraymond> issue #210 - non muxed RTP RTCP dtls transports
[10:42] <robinraymond> issue #211 - takes time to generate certificates
[10:42] <robinraymond> issue #218 - how do we use the same fingerprint across all forks of dtls transport
[10:44] <robinraymond> issue 210 - offering different fingerprints for RTP vs RTCP
[10:46] <robinraymond> issue #210 - or mandate they are the smae
[10:46] <robinraymond> issue #211 - make it a promise for getLocalParams
[10:46] <robinraymond> issue #218 - DtlsTransport.cloneTransport ? ugg :(
[10:57] <robinraymond> certificate management is the way to go for dtls transport
[10:57] <robinraymond> is optional param in constructor?
[10:57] <robinraymond> lets do up some samples
[11:11] <robinraymond> issue #170 - "should" buffer incoming DTLS packets before DTLS transport is attached ICE transport - use SHOULD in the spec
[11:13] <robinraymond> rename "getOrCreateTransport"
[11:29] <robinraymond> added failed state to DTLS transport
[11:33] <robinraymond> PR webRTC 1.0 for DTMF sender CamelCase
